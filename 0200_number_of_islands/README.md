# [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/)

Given an <code>m x n</code> 2D binary grid <code>grid</code> which represents a map of <code>'1'</code>s (land) and <code>'0'</code>s (water), return the number of islands.

An **island**  is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>m == grid.length</code>
- <code>n == grid[i].length</code>
- <code>1 <= m, n <= 300</code>
- <code>grid[i][j]</code> is <code>'0'</code> or <code>'1'</code>.:w
