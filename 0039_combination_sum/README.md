# [39. Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/description/)

You are given an integer array <code>coins</code> representing coins of
different denominations and an integer <code>amount</code> representing a total
amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that
amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return
<code>-1</code>.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= coins.length <= 12</code>
- <code>1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1</code>
- <code>0 <= amount <= 10^4</code>
